vintage-basic
=============

Vintage BASIC Interpreter in C#, inspired by the [Haskell implementation](https://github.com/lylek/vintage-basic).

Most of the initial code was written by [Jules](https://jules.google.com) using the Haskell code as reference.
The result more-or-less worked, although some manual tweaking was needed to get all the examples to run.
Once sufficient unit tests were in place, I started refactoring the code to make the C# something I could
actually stand to look at; AI generated code may run, but it may not be something you want to look at.

Pull requests are welcome!
